# PBX

> **Warning** This is an experimental project.

PBX is a reimagining of [Patchboard][1] with the following design goals:

* Support for the Patchboard API description schema

* Modularization of the architecture

* Simplification of request classification

* Support for ES6 (mostly via generator/promise-based interfaces)

* Optimizations for common development scenarios

Although PBX is currently a single library, the idea is to package and release it as several standalone libraries that can interoperate. We want to empower developers to pick and choose the tools they want to use and to ultimately be able to create their our Patchboard-based solutions.

These components include:

* A validator that uses [JSCK][2] for JSON schema validation. Validators are used to validate API definitions, query parameters, and request and response bodies.

* A client that uses [Shred][3] to generate HTTP API clients based on the API definition.

* A builder for creating API definitions quickly, much like you can do with frameworks like [Restify][4] and [Express][5] (except the definitions are valid Patchboard API definitions and can be discovered/reflected upon).

* A classifier for determining the `(resource, action)` pair associated with a given request.

* A context object that provides a series of helper methods for dealing with requests and responses, leveraging the API definition to do so.

* A processor that provides a standard request handler for use with the [Node HTTP API][6].

* A collection of behaviors encapsulating common API scenarios, such as providing an HTTP interface to a storage backend.

## Example: A Simple Blog Engine

First, let's define our API:

```coffee
{Builder} = require "pbx"

builder.define "blogs",
  path: "/blogs"
.post
  as: "create"
  creates: "blog"

builder.define "blog",
  template: "/blogs/:name"
.get()
.put()
.delete()
.post
  creates: "post"
.schema
  required: ["name", "title"]
  properties:
    name: type: "string"
    title: type: "string"

builder.define "post",
  template: "/blog/:name/:key"
.get()
.put()
.delete()
.schema
  required: ["key", "title", "content"]
  properties:
    key: type: "string"
    title: type: "string"
    content: type: "string"

builder.reflect()

module.exports = builder.api
```

This API allows to create blogs, view and update them, and delete them. We can also do the same for posts within a blog. We also added reflection to our API, which means the Patchboard API definition is available via a `GET` request to `/`.

For example, if we have a blog named `my-blog` and a post named `pbx-example`, the API above would allow us to read that post with the following `curl` command:

```
$ curl 'http://acmeblogging.com/blog/my-blog/pbx-example'
    -H'accept:application.vnd.post+json;version=1.0
```

Let's serve up the API using the Node HTTP `createServer` method:

```coffee
{call} = require "when/generator"
{processor} = require "pbx"
api = require "./api"

call ->
  (require "http")
  .createServer yield (processor api, (-> {}))
  .listen 8080
```

If we run this, we'll have an HTTP server for our API running on port `8080` on `localhost`. We can even use `curl` to get a description of the interface:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/ -H'accept: application/json'
```

Wait, thoughâ€¦this API doesn't actually _do_ anything. We haven't created any behaviors to bind it to. That's what's going on with the function we're passing into the `pbx` function, which returns an empty object literal: `(-> {})`.

The `pbx` function takes our API definition and an initializer function that returns a set of handlers for each action defined by the API.

> **Separation of Interface and Implementation** Defining the API _interface_ separate from the _implementation_ is different from most other HTTP libraries. One benefit of this separation is that we can generate our implementation based on the API, or even make it dynamic (say, using JavaScript proxies).

> These dynamic implementation patterns are called _behaviors_. Behaviors open up a variety of possibilities for implementations. In this example, we'll simply define explicit handler functions for each action. But behaviors make it possible to encapsulate an reuse common patters (like storing a resource in a database).

See the [example app](./examples/blog/) for more.
