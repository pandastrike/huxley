This sub-command allows you to add arbitrary data to the cluster of your choice.
Use this command for storage that does not trigger a deployment cascade.

This command actually accomplishes three things:
(1) Creates a repository on the target cluster's hook server
(2) Adds a git remote alias to your local repository that targets the remote cluster.
(3) Pushes the local repo to the cluster.  No githook is triggered.
