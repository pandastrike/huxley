This sub-command allows you to add githook scripts to the cluster of your choice.
This command acutally accomplishes three things:

(1) Creates a repository on the target cluster's hook server
(2) Places a special post-receive githook in that repository to trigger deployment
(3) Adds a git remote alias to your local repository that targets the remote cluster.
